## How It Works

1. **We scrape** thousands of job boards, company career pages, and ATS platforms daily
2. **We verify** every job is still live on the employer's site — dead links are removed automatically
3. **We tag** each job with skills, seniority, salary, and region using AI extraction
4. **You apply** in one click via [wagey.gg](https://wagey.gg?ref=github) — upload your CV once, then auto-apply to any job
